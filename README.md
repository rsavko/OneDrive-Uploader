# OneDrive-Uploader
Script used to upload all content from the current directory into OneDrive.

The main goal of this script was to create a backup of my photos within OneDrive. For e.g., on my computer I had a folder "Pictures" with fotos sorted by year: "2004", "2005", etc. and I wanted to upload all of those files with the same folder structure into OneDrive under "Pictures" folder.
Put this script under directory from which you want to upload all content and it will upload all files/folders to OneDrive under specified folder ("Pictures" by default).
